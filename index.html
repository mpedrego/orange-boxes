                    I was born and raised in <span>Phoenix, AZ</span>. My entire extended family has been in the landscaping and construction business for over 40 years. My very first job was digging holes, and I have probably dug over 100 holes!

                    <span>My passion</span>: I love music, art and love encouraging people to express their passions. I host a podcast called, "The Outlet" where we interview hard working local artists and give them a platform to share their stories.

                    While growing up in the urban part of Phoenix, I noticed the community lacked rescoures for the youth. My goal is to eventually create a rec center for Maryvale, to give them the opprotunities to <span>create art</span> with an outlet to express themselves in a safe environment!
